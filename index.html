					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
                    <p>2+ years of volunteer experience in building and managing tech communities. I am frequently found driving engagements and communications across various community platforms such as Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Microsoft Teams. With a knack for driving community-powered success that leads to member upskilling, I was able to increase the number of community members who are certified by 67 percent. I've gained experience in teamwork, community engagement, communication, and community management. I am currently seeking to use my passion for community building and management as a community manager.
